During the past twenty years there has been an extraordinary
growth of interest in Zen Buddhism. Since the Second World War
this interest has increased so much that it seems to be becoming a
considerable force in the intellectual and artistic world of the West.
It is connected, no doubt, with the prevalent enthusiasm for
Japanese culture which is one of the constructive results of the late
war, but which may amount to no more than a passing fashion. The
deeper reason for this interest is that the viewpoint of Zen lies so
close to the “growing edge” of Western thought.
The more alarming and destructive aspects of Western civilization
should not blind us to the fact that at this very time it is also in one
of its most creative periods. Ideas and insights of the greatest
fascination are appearing in some of the newer +elds of Western
science–in psychology and psychotherapy, in logic and the
philosophy of science, in semantics and communications theory.
Some of these developments might be due to suggestive in-uences
from Asian philosophy, but on the whole I am inclined to feel that
there is more of a parallelism than a direct in-uence. We are,
however, becoming aware of the parallelism, and it promises an
exchange of views which should be extremely stimulating.
Western thought has changed so rapidly in this century that we
are in a state of considerable confusion. Not only are there serious
di/culties of communication between the intellectual and the
general public, but the course of our thinking and of our very
history has seriously undermined the common-sense assumptions
which lie at the roots of our social conventions and institutions.
Familiar concepts of space, time, and motion, of nature and natural
law, of history and social change, and of human personality itself
have dissolved, and we +nd ourselves adrift without landmarks in a
universe which more and more resembles the Buddhist principle of
the “Great Void.” The various wisdoms of the West, religious,
philosophical, and scienti+c, do not o4er much guidance to the art
pp,  ,     g  
of living in such a universe, and we +nd the prospects of making
our way in so trackless an ocean of relativity rather frightening. For
we are used to absolutes, to +rm principles and laws to which we
can cling for spiritual and psychological security.
This is why, I think, there is so much interest in a culturally
productive way of life which, for some +fteen hundred years, has
felt thoroughly at home in “the Void,” and which not only feels no
terror for it but rather a positive delight. To use its own words, the
situation of Zen has always been–
Above, not a tile to cover the head;
Below, not an inch of ground for the foot.
Such language should not actually be so unfamiliar to us, were we
truly prepared to accept the meaning of “the foxes have holes, and
the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath not where
to lay his head.”
I am not in favor of “importing” Zen from the Far East, for it has
become deeply involved with cultural institutions which are quite
foreign to us. But there is no doubt that there are things which we
can learn, or unlearn, from it and apply in our own way. It has the
special merit of a mode of expressing itself which is as intelligible–
or perhaps as ba8ing–to the intellectual as to the illiterate, o4ering
possibilities of communication which we have not explored. It has
a directness, verve, and humor, and a sense of both beauty and
nonsense at once exasperating and delightful. But above all it has a
way of being able to turn one’s mind inside out, and dissolving
what seemed to be the most oppressive human problems into
questions like “Why is a mouse when it spins?” At its heart there is
a strong but completely unsentimental compassion for human
beings su4ering and perishing from their very attempts to save
themselves.
There are many excellent books about Zen, though some of the
best are out of print or otherwise di/cult to obtain. But as yet no
one–not even Professor Suzuki—has given us a comprehensive
account of the subject which includes its historical background and
   j     g
its relation to Chinese and Indian ways of thought. The three
volumes of Suzuki’s Essays in Zen Buddhism are an unsystematic
collection of scholarly papers on various aspects of the subject,
enormously useful for the advanced student but quite ba8ing to the
general reader without an understanding of the general principles.
His delightful Introduction to Zen Buddhism is rather narrow and
specialized. It omits the essential information about the relation of
Zen to Chinese Taoism and Indian Buddhism, and is in some
respects rather more mystifying than it need be. His other works are
studies of special aspects of Zen, all of which require general
background and historical perspective.
R. H. Blyth’s Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics is one
of the best introductions available, but it is published only in Japan
and, again, lacks the background information. As a series of
rambling and marvelously perceptive observations, it makes no
attempt to give an orderly presentation of the subject. My own
Spirit of Zen is a popularization of Suzuki’s earlier works, and
besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and
misleading, whatever merits it may have in the way of lucidity and
simplicity. Christmas Humphreys’ Zen Buddhism, published only in
England, is likewise a popularization of Suzuki and, once more,
does not really begin to put Zen in its cultural context. It is written
in a clear and sprightly fashion, but the author +nds identities
between Buddhism and Theosophy which I feel to be highly
questionable. Other studies of Zen by both Western and Asian
authors are of a more specialized character, or are discussions of
Zen à propos of something else–psychology, art, or cultural history.
In default, then, of a fundamental, orderly, and comprehensive
account of the subject, it is no wonder that Western impressions of
Zen are somewhat confused, despite all the enthusiasm and interest
which it has aroused. The problem, then, is to write such a book–
and this I have tried to do since no one who understands the subject
better than I seems willing or able to do so. Ideally, I suppose, such
a work should be written by an accomplished and recognized Zen
master. But at present no such person has su/cient command of
English. Furthermore, when one speaks from within a tradition, and
g ,   p    ,
especially from within its institutional hierarchy, there is always apt
to be a certain lack of perspective and grasp of the outsider’s
viewpoint. Again, one of the biggest obstacles to communication
between Japanese Zen masters and Westerners is the absence of
clarity as to di4erence of basic cultural premises. Both sides are so
“set in their ways” that they are unaware of the limitations of their
means of communication.
Perhaps, then, the most appropriate author of such a work would
be a Westerner who had spent some years under a Japanese master,
going through the whole course of Zen training. Now from the
standpoint of Western “scienti+c scholarship” this would not do at
all, for such a person would have become an “enthusiast” and
“partisan” incapable of an objective and disinterested view. But,
fortunately or unfortunately, Zen is above all an experience,
nonverbal in character, which is simply inaccessible to the purely
literary and scholarly approach. To know what Zen is, and
especially what it is not, there is no alternative but to practice it, to
experiment with it in the concrete so as to discover the meaning
which underlies the words. Yet such Westerners as have undergone
some of the special type of training followed in Rinzai Zen tend to
become “cagey” and uncommunicative on the principle that
Those who know do not speak;
Those who speak do not know.
Although, however, they do not “put up,” they do not completely
“shut up.” On the one hand, they would love to share their
understanding with others. But on the other hand, they are
convinced that words are ultimately futile, and are, furthermore,
under an agreement not to discuss certain aspects of their training.
They begin, therefore, to take the characteristically Asian attitude of
“Come and +nd out for yourself.” But the scienti+cally trained
Westerner is, not without reason, a cautious and skeptical fellow
who likes to know what he is “getting into.” He is acutely conscious
of the capacity of the mind for self-deception, for going into places
where entrance is impossible without leaving one’s critical
   p  g 
perspective at the door. Asians tend so much to despise this
attitude, and their Western devotees even more so, that they neglect
to tell the scienti+c inquirer many things that are still well within
the possibilities of human speech and intellectual understanding.
To write about Zen is, therefore, as problematic for the outside,
“objective” observer as for the inside, “subjective” disciple. In
varying situations I have found myself on both sides of the
dilemma. I have associated and studied with the “objective
observers” and am convinced that, for all their virtues, they
invariably miss the point and eat the menu instead of the dinner. I
have also been on the inside of a traditional hierarchy–not Zen–and
am equally convinced that from this position one does not know
what dinner is being eaten. In such a position one becomes
technically “idiotic,” which is to say, out of communication with
those who do not belong to the same fold.
It is both dangerous and absurd for our world to be a group of
communions mutually excommunicate. This is especially true of the
great cultures of the East and the West, where the potentialities of
communication are the richest, and the dangers of failure to
communicate the worst. As one who has spent somewhat more than
twenty years trying to interpret the East to the West, I have become
increasingly certain that to interpret such a phenomenon as Zen
there is a clear principle to be followed. On the one hand, it is
necessary to be sympathetic and to experiment personally with the
way of life to the limit of one’s possibilities. On the other hand, one
must resist every temptation to “join the organization,” to become
involved with its institutional commitments. In this friendly neutral
position one is apt to be disowned by both sides. But, at the worst,
one’s misrepresentations provoke them to express themselves more
clearly. For the relationship between two positions becomes far
more clear when there is a third with which to compare them. Thus
even if this study of Zen does no more than express a standpoint
which is neither Zen nor anything Western, it will at least provide
that third point of reference.
However, there can be no doubt that the essential standpoint of
Zen refuses to be organized, or to be made the exclusive possession
    g,       p
of any institution. If there is anything in this world which transcends
the relativities of cultural conditioning, it is Zen–by whatever name
it may be called. This is an excellent reason for Zen’s not being
institutionalized, and for the fact that many of its ancient exponents
were “universal individualists” who were never members of any
Zen organization, and never sought the acknowledgment of any
formal authority.
This, then, is my position with respect to Zen–and I feel I should
be frank with the reader in a day when there is so much anxiety
about people’s credentials or “quanti+cations.” I cannot represent
myself as a Zenist, or even as a Buddhist, for this seems to me to be
like trying to wrap up and label the sky. I cannot represent myself
as a scienti+cally objective academician, for–with respect to Zen–
this seems to me to be like studying bird–song in a collection of
stu4ed nightingales. I claim no rights to speak of Zen. I claim only
the pleasure of having studied its literature and observed its art
forms since I was hardly more than a boy, and of having had the
delight of informal association with a number of Japanese and
Chinese travelers of the same trackless way.
This book is intended both for the general reader and for the
more serious student, and I trust that the former will be tolerant of
the use of some technical terminology, a Chinese character
appendix, and other critical apparatus most useful for those who
wish to explore the subject more deeply. The book is divided into
two parts, the +rst dealing with the background and history of Zen,
and the second with its principles and practice. The sources of
information are of three types. I have, +rstly, used almost all the
studies of Zen in European languages. Naturally, I have made
considerable use of the works of Professor D. T. Suzuki, but at the
same time I have tried not to rely upon them too heavily–not
because of any defect in them, but because I think readers are
entitled to something more, by way of a fresh viewpoint, than a
mere summarization of his views.
Secondly, I have based the essential view of Zen here presented
upon a careful study of the more important of its early Chinese
records, with special reference to the Hsin-hsin Ming, the T’an
,  p     g, 
Ching or Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, the Lin-chi Lu, and the Kutsun-hsü Yü-lu. My own knowledge of T’ang dynasty Chinese is
certainly not enough to deal with some of the +ner points of this
literature, but su/cient, I think, to get what I wanted, which was a
clear view of the essential doctrine. In all this, my e4orts have been
greatly aided by colleagues and research associates at the American
Academy of Asian Studies, and I wish in particular to express my
thanks to Professors Sabro Hasegawa and Gi-ming Shien, to Dr. Paul
and Dr. George Fung, Dr. Frederick Hong, Mr. Charles Yick, and to
Mr. Kazumitsu Kato, priest of the Soto-Zen School.
Thirdly, my information is derived from a large number of
personal encounters with teachers and students of Zen, spread over
more than twenty years.
In the following pages the translations from the original texts are
my own, unless otherwise indicated. For the convenience of those
who read Chinese, I have supplied, following the Bibliography, an
appendix of the original Chinese forms of the more important
quotations and technical terms. I have found these almost essential
for the more serious student, for even among the most highly
quali+ed scholars there is still much uncertainty as to the proper
translation of T’ang dynasty Zen texts. References to this appendix
are by superscribed index letters in alphabetical order.
References to other works are by surname of the author and
number, directing the reader to the Bibliography for full details.
Scholarly readers will have to excuse me for not using the absurd
diacritical marks in romanized Sanskrit words, since these are
merely confusing to the general reader and unnecessary to the
Sanskritist who will at once call to mind the Devanagiri script. As to
the proper names of Zen masters and titles of Zen texts, these are
given in the romanized forms of Mandarin or Japanese according to
the country of origin, and technical terms are given in Mandarin
unless used in the discussion of speci+cally Japanese Zen. For
Mandarin one is almost compelled by general usage to adopt the
Wade-Giles romanization, for which I have appended a table of
pronunciation following this Preface, since it has so little relation to
the actual sounds.
 
I am most grateful to Mr. R. H. Blyth for his kind permission to
quote a number of his translations of haiku poems from his
magni+cent four-volume anthology, Haiku, published by the
Hokuseido Press in Tokyo; to Professor Sabro Hasegawa for his
generous help in preparing the jacket and providing illustrations;
and to my daughter Joan for the photographs of Ryoanji.
In conclusion, I am most happy to express my thanks to the
Bollingen Foundation for a three-year fellowship, during which
much of the preliminary study was done for the writing of this
book.

PART ONE
BACKGROUND AND HISTORY
One
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE TAO
Zen Buddhism is a way and a view of life which does not belong to
any of the formal categories of modern Western thought. It is not
religion or philosophy; it is not a psychology or a type of science. It
is an example of what is known in India and China as a “way of
liberation,” and is similar in this respect to Taoism, Vedanta, and
Yoga. As will soon be obvious, a way of liberation can have no
positive de.nition. It has to be suggested by saying what it is not,
somewhat as a sculptor reveals an image by the act of removing
pieces of stone from a block.
Historically, Zen may be regarded as the ful.llment of long
traditions of Indian and Chinese culture, though it is actually much
more Chinese than Indian, and, since the twelfth century, it has
rooted itself deeply and most creatively in the culture of Japan. As
the fruition of these great cultures, and as a unique and peculiarly
instructive example of a way of liberation, Zen is one of the most
precious gifts of Asia to the world.
The origins of Zen are as much Taoist as Buddhist, and, because
its 1avor is so peculiarly Chinese, it may be best to begin by
inquiring into its Chinese ancestry–illustrating, at the same time,
what is meant by a way of liberation by the example of Taoism.
Much of the di4culty and mysti.cation which Zen presents to the
Western student is the result of his unfamiliarity with Chinese ways
of thinking–ways which di5er startlingly from our own and which
are, for that very reason, of special value to us in attaining a critical
perspective upon our own ideas. The problem here is not simply
one of mastering di5erent ideas, di5ering from our own as, say, the
theories of Kant di5er from those of Descartes, or those of Calvinists
from those of Catholics. The problem is to appreciate di5erences in
     p   pp 
the basic premises of thought and in the very methods of thinking,
and these are so often overlooked that our interpretations of
Chinese philosophy are apt to be a projection of characteristically
Western ideas into Chinese terminology. This is the inevitable
disadvantage of studying Asian philosophy by the purely literary
methods of Western scholarship, for words can be communicative
only between those who share similar experiences.
This is not to go so far as to say that so rich and subtle a language
as English is simply incapable of expressing Chinese ideas. On the
contrary, it can say much more than has been believed possible by
some Chinese and Japanese students of Zen and Taoism whose
familiarity with English leaves something to be desired. The
di4culty is not so much in the language as in the thought-patterns
which have hitherto seemed inseparable from the academic and
scienti.c way of approaching a subject. The unsuitability of these
patterns for such subjects as Taoism and Zen is largely responsible
for the impression that the “Oriental mind” is mysterious, irrational,
and inscrutable. Furthermore, it need not be supposed that these
matters are so peculiarly Chinese or Japanese that they have no
point of contact with anything in our own culture. While it is true
that none of the formal divisions of Western science and thought
corresponds to a way of liberation, R. H. Blyth’s marvelous study of
Zen in English Literature has shown most clearly that the essential
insights of Zen are universal.
The reason why Taoism and Zen present, at .rst sight, such a
puzzle to the Western mind is that we have taken a restricted view
of human knowledge. For us, almost all knowledge is what a Taoist
would call conventional knowledge, because we do not feel that we
really know anything unless we can represent it to ourselves in
words, or in some other system of conventional signs such as the
notations of mathematics or music. Such knowledge is called
conventional because it is a matter of social agreement as to the
codes of communication. Just as people speaking the same
language have tacit agreements as to what words shall stand for
what things, so the members of every society and every culture are
united by bonds of communication resting upon all kinds of
 y    g p  
agreement as to the classi.cation and valuation of actions and
things.
Thus the task of education is to make children .t to live in a
society by persuading them to learn and accept its codes–the rules
and conventions of communication whereby the society holds itself
together. There is .rst the spoken language. The child is taught to
accept “tree” and not “boojum” as the agreed sign for that (pointing
to the object). We have no di4culty in understanding that the word
“tree” is a matter of convention. What is much less obvious is that
convention also governs the delineation of the thing to which the
word is assigned. For the child has to be taught not only what
words are to stand for what things, but also the way in which his
culture has tacitly agreed to divide things from each other, to mark
out the boundaries within our daily experience. Thus scienti.c
convention decides whether an eel shall be a .sh or a snake, and
grammatical convention determines what experiences shall be
called objects and what shall be called events or actions. How
arbitrary such conventions may be can be seen from the question,
“What happens to my .st [noun-object] when I open my hand?”
The object miraculously vanishes because an action was disguised
by a part of speech usually assigned to a thing! In English the
di5erences between things and actions are clearly, if not always
logically, distinguished, but a great number of Chinese words do
duty for both nouns and verbs–so that one who thinks in Chinese
has little di4culty in seeing that objects are also events, that our
world is a collection of processes rather than entities.
Besides language, the child has to accept many other forms of
code. For the necessities of living together require agreement as to
codes of law and ethics, of etiquette and art, of weights, measures,
and numbers, and, above all, of role. We have di4culty in
communicating with each other unless we can identify ourselves in
terms of roles–father, teacher, worker, artist, “regular guy,”
gentleman, sportsman, and so forth. To the extent that we identify
ourselves with these stereotypes and the rules of behavior
associated with them, we ourselves feel that we are someone
because our fellows have less di4culty in accepting us-that is, in
     y  pg  ,
identifying us and feeling that we are “under control.” A meeting of
two strangers at a party is always somewhat embarrassing when the
host has not identi.ed their roles in introducing them, for neither
knows what rules of conversation and action should be observed.
Once again, it is easy to see the conventional character of roles.
For a man who is a father may also be a doctor and an artist, as
well as an employee and a brother. And it is obvious that even the
sum total of these role labels will be far from supplying an
adequate description of the man himself, even though it may place
him in certain general classi.cations. But the conventions which
govern human identity are more subtle and much less obvious than
these. We learn, very thoroughly though far less explicitly, to
identify ourselves with an equally conventional view of “myself.”
For the conventional “self” or “person” is composed mainly of a
history consisting of selected memories, and beginning from the
moment of parturition. According to convention, I am not simply
what I am doing now. I am also what I have done, and my
conventionally edited version of my past is made to seem almost
more the real “me” than what I am at this moment. For what I am
seems so fleeting and intangible, but what I was is .xed and .nal. It
is the .rm basis for predictions of what I will be in the future, and
so it comes about that I am more closely identi.ed with what no
longer exists than with what actually is!
It is important to recognize that the memories and past events
which make up a man’s historical identity are no more than a
selection. From the actual in.nitude of events and experiences
some have been picked out–abstracted–as signi.cant, and this
signi.cance has of course been determined by conventional
standards. For the very nature of conventional knowledge is that it
is a system of abstractions. It consists of signs and symbols in which
things and events are reduced to their general outlines, as the
Chinese character j e n a stands for “man” by being the utmost
simplification and generalization of the human form.
The same is true of words other than ideographs. The English
words “man,” “.sh,” “star,” “1ower,” “run,” “grow,” all denote
classes of objects or events which may be recognized as members of
  j    y  g  
their class by very simple attributes, abstracted from the total
complexity of the things themselves.
Abstraction is thus almost a necessity for communication, since it
enables us to represent our experiences with simple and rapidly
made “grasps” of the mind. When we say that we can think only of
one thing at a time, this is like saying that the Paci.c Ocean cannot
be swallowed at a gulp. It has to be taken in a cup, and downed bit
by bit. Abstractions and conventional signs are like the cup; they
reduce experience to units simple enough to be comprehended one
at a time. In a similar way, curves are measured by reducing them
to a sequence of tiny straight lines, or by thinking of them in terms
of the squares which they cross when plotted on graph paper.
Other examples of the same process are the newspaper
photograph and the transmission of television. In the former, a
natural scene is reproduced in terms of light and heavy dots
arranged in a screen or gridlike pattern so as to give the general
impression of a black-and-white photograph when seen without a
magnifying glass. Much as it may look like the original scene, it is
only a reconstruction of the scene in terms of dots, somewhat as our
conventional words and thoughts are reconstructions of experience
in terms of abstract signs. Even more like the thought process, the
television camera transmits a natural scene in terms of a linear
series of impulses which may be passed along a wire.
Thus communication by conventional signs of this type gives us
an abstract, one-at-a-time translation of a universe in which things
are happening altogether-at-once–a universe whose concrete reality
always escapes perfect description in these abstract terms. The
perfect description of a small particle of dust by these means would
take everlasting time, since one would have to account for every
point in its volume.
The linear, one-at-a-time character of speech and thought is
particularly noticeable in all languages using alphabets,
representing experience in long strings of letters. It is not easy to
say why we must communicate with others (speak) and with
ourselves (think) by this one-at-a-time method. Life itself does not
proceed in this cumbersome, linear fashion, and our own organisms
p   ,  ,    g
could hardly live for a moment if they had to control themselves by
taking thought of every breath, every beat of the heart, and every
neural impulse. But if we are to .nd some explanation for this
characteristic of thought, the sense of sight o5ers a suggestive
analogy. For we have two types of vision–central and peripheral,
not unlike the spotlight and the 1oodlight. Central vision is used for
accurate work like reading, in which our eyes are focused on one
small area after another like spotlights. Peripheral vision is less
conscious, less bright than the intense ray of the spotlight. We use it
for seeing at night, and for taking “subconscious” notice of objects
and movements not in the direct line of central vision. Unlike the
spotlight, it can take in very many things at a time.
There is, then, an analogy–and perhaps more than mere analogy–
between central vision and conscious, one-at-a-time thinking, and
between peripheral vision and the rather mysterious process which
enables us to regulate the incredible complexity of our bodies
without thinking at all. It should be noted, further, that we call our
bodies complex as a result of trying to understand them in terms of
linear thought, of words and concepts. But the complexity is not so
much in our bodies as in the task of trying to understand them by
this means of thinking. It is like trying to make out the features of a
large room with no other light than a single bright ray. It is as
complicated as trying to drink water with a fork instead of a cup.
In this respect, the Chinese written language has a slight
advantage over our own, and is perhaps symptomatic of a di5erent
way of thinking. It is still linear, still a series of abstractions taken
in one at a time. But its written signs are a little closer to life than
spelled words because they are essentially pictures, and, as a
Chinese proverb puts it, “One showing is worth a hundred sayings.”
Compare, for example, the ease of showing someone how to tie a
complex knot with the di4culty of telling him how to do it in
words alone.
Now the general tendency of the Western mind is to feel that we
do not really understand what we cannot represent, what we cannot
communicate, by linear signs–by thinking. We are like the
“wall1ower” who cannot learn a dance unless someone draws him
        
a diagram of the steps, who cannot “get it by the feel.” For some
reason we do not trust and do not fully use the “peripheral vision”
of our minds. We learn music, for example, by restricting the whole
range of tone and rhythm to a notation of .xed tonal and rhythmic
intervals–a notation which is incapable of representing Oriental
music. But the Oriental musician has a rough notation which he
uses only as a reminder of a melody. He learns music, not by
reading notes, but by listening to the performance of a teacher,
getting the “feel” of it, and copying him, and this enables him to
acquire rhythmic and tonal sophistications matched only by those
Western jazz artists who use the same approach.
We are not suggesting that Westerners simply do not use the
“peripheral mind.” Being human, we use it all the time, and every
artist, every workman, every athlete calls into play some special
development of its powers. But it is not academically and
philosophically respectable. We have hardly begun to realize its
possibilities, and it seldom, if ever, occurs to us that one of its most
important uses is for that “knowledge of reality” which we try to
attain by the cumbersome calculations of theology, metaphysics,
and logical inference.
When we turn to ancient Chinese society, we .nd two
“philosophical” traditions playing complementary parts–
Confucianism and Taoism. Generally speaking, the former concerns
itself with the linguistic, ethical, legal, and ritual conventions which
provide the society with its system of communication.
Confucianism, in other words, preoccupies itself with conventional
knowledge, and under its auspices children are brought up so that
their originally wayward and whimsical natures are made to .t the
Procrustean bed of the social order. The individual de.nes himself
and his place in society in terms of the Confucian formulae.
Taoism, on the other hand, is generally a pursuit of older men,
and especially of men who are retiring from active life in the
community. Their retirement from society is a kind of outward
symbol of an inward liberation from the bounds of conventional
patterns of thought and conduct. For Taoism concerns itself with
unconventional knowledge, with the understanding of life directly,
 g,   g   y,
instead of in the abstract, linear terms of representational thinking.
Confucianism presides, then, over the socially necessary task of
forcing the original spontaneity of life into the rigid rules of
convention–a task which involves not only con1ict and pain, but
also the loss of that peculiar naturalness and un-self-consciousness
for which little children are so much loved, and which is sometimes
regained by saints and sages. The function of Taoism is to undo the
inevitable damage of this discipline, and not only to restore but also
to develop the original spontaneity, which is termed tzu-jan b or
“self-so-ness.” For the spontaneity of a child is still childish, like
everything else about him. His education fosters his rigidity but not
his spontaneity. In certain natures, the con1ict between social
convention and repressed spontaneity is so violent that it manifests
itself in crime, insanity, and neurosis, which are the prices we pay
for the otherwise undoubted benefits of order.
But Taoism must on no account be understood as a revolution
against convention, although it has sometimes been used as a
pretext for revolution. Taoism is a way of liberation, which never
comes by means of revolution, since it is notorious that most
revolutions establish worse tyrannies than they destroy. To be free
from convention is not to spurn it but not to be deceived by it. It is
to be able to use it as an instrument instead of being used by it.
The West has no recognized institution corresponding to Taoism
because our Hebrew-Christian spiritual tradition identi.es the
Absolute–God–with the moral and logical order of convention. This
might almost be called a major cultural catastrophe, because it
weights the social order with excessive authority, inviting just those
revolutions against religion and tradition which have been so
characteristic of Western history. It is one thing to feel oneself in
con1ict with socially sanctioned conventions, but quite another to
feel at odds with the very root and ground of life, with the Absolute
itself. The latter feeling nurtures a sense of guilt so preposterous
that it must issue either in denying one’s own nature or in rejecting
God. Because the .rst of these alternatives is ultimately impossible–
like chewing o5 one’s own teeth–the second becomes inevitable,
where such palliatives as the confessional are no longer effective. As
  p      g 
is the nature of revolutions, the revolution against God gives place
to the worse tyranny of the absolutist state–worse because it cannot
even forgive, and because it recognizes nothing outside the powers
of its jurisdiction. For while the latter was theoretically true of God,
his earthly representative the Church was always prepared to admit
that though the laws of God were immutable, no one could
presume to name the limits of his mercy. When the throne of the
Absolute is left vacant, the relative usurps it and commits the real
idolatry, the real indignity against God–the absolutizing of a
concept, a conventional abstraction. But it is unlikely that the
throne would have become vacant if, in a sense, it had not been so
already–if the Western tradition had had some way of
apprehending the Absolute directly, outside the terms of the
conventional order.
Of course the very word “Absolute” suggests to us something
abstract and conceptual, such as “Pure Being.” Our very idea of
“spirit” as opposed to “matter” seems to have more kinship with
the abstract than the concrete. But with Taoism, as with other ways
of liberation, the Absolute must never be confused with the abstract.
On the other hand, if we say that the Tao,c as the ultimate Reality is
called, is the concrete rather than the abstract, this may lead to still
other confusions. For we are accustomed to associate the concrete
with the material, the physiological, the biological, and the natural,
as distinct from the supernatural. But from the Taoist and Buddhist
standpoints these are still terms for conventional and abstract
spheres of knowledge.
Biology and physiology, for example, are types of knowledge
which represent the real world in terms of their own special
abstract categories. They measure and classify that world in ways
appropriate to the particular uses they want to make of it,
somewhat as a surveyor deals with earth in terms of acres, a
contractor in truckloads or tons, and a soil analyst in types of
chemical structures. To say that the concrete reality of the human
organism is physiological is like saying that the earth is so many
tons or acres. And to say that this reality is natural is accurate
enough if we mean spontaneous (tzu-jan) or natura naturans
g    p (j)  
(“nature naturing”). But it is quite inaccurate if we mean natura
naturata (“nature natured”), that is to say, nature classi.ed, sorted
into “natures” as when we ask, “What is the nature of this thing?” It
is in this sense of the word that we must think of “scienti.c
naturalism,” a doctrine which has nothing in common with the
naturalism of Taoism.
Thus to begin to understand what Taoism is about, we must at
least be prepared to admit the possibility of some view of the
world other than the conventional, some knowledge other than the
contents of our surface consciousness, which can apprehend reality
only in the form of one abstraction (or thought, the Chinese nien d)
at a time. There is no real di4culty in this, for we will already
admit that we “know” how to move our hands, how to make a
decision, or how to breathe, even though we can hardly begin to
explain how we do it in words. We know how to do it because we
just do it! Taoism is an extension of this kind of knowledge, an
extension which gives us a very di5erent view of ourselves from
that to which we are conventionally accustomed, and a view which
liberates the human mind from its constricting identi.cation with
the abstract ego.
According to tradition, the originator of Taoism, Lao-tzu, was an
older contemporary of Kung Fu-tzu, or Confucius, who died in 479
B.C.1 Lao-tzu is said to have been the author of the Tao Te Ching, a
short book of aphorisms, setting forth the principles of the Tao and
its power or virtue (T e e). But traditional Chinese philosophy
ascribes both Taoism and Confucianism to a still earlier source, to a
work which lies at the very foundation of Chinese thought and
culture, dating anywhere from 3000 to 1200 B.C. This is the I
Ching, or Book of Changes.
T he I Ching is ostensibly a book of divination. It consists of
oracles based on sixty-four abstract .gures, each of which is
composed of six lines. The lines are of two kinds—divided
(negative) and undivided (positive)— and the six-line .gures, or
hexagrams, are believed to have been based on the various ways in
which a tortoise shell will crack when heated.2 This refers to an
ancient method of divination in which the soothsayer bored a hole
       y  
in the back of a tortoise shell, heated it, and then foretold the future
from the cracks in the shell so formed, much as palmists use the
lines on the hand. Naturally, these cracks were most complicated,
and the sixty-four hexagrams are supposed to be a simpli.ed
classi.cation of the various patterns of cracks. For many centuries
now the tortoise shell has fallen into disuse, and instead the
hexagram appropriate to the moment in which a question is asked
of the oracle is determined by the random division of a set of .fty
yarrow stalks.
But an expert in the I Ching need not necessarily use tortoise
shells or yarrow stalks. He can “see” a hexagram in anything–in the
chance arrangement of a bowl of 1owers, in objects scattered upon
a table, in the natural markings on a pebble. A modern psychologist
will recognize in this something not unlike a Rorschach test, in
which the psychological condition of a patient is diagnosed from
the spontaneous images which he “sees” in a complex ink-blot.
Could the patient interpret his own projections upon the ink-blot,
he would have some useful information about himself for the
guidance of his future conduct. In view of this, we cannot dismiss
the divinatory art of the I Ching as mere superstition.
Indeed, an exponent of the I Ching might give us quite a tough
argument about the relative merits of our ways for making
important decisions. We feel that we decide rationally because we
base our decisions on collecting relevant data about the matter in
hand. We do not depend upon such irrelevant tri1es as the chance
tossing of a coin, or the patterns of tea leaves or cracks in a shell.
Yet he might ask whether we really know what information is
relevant, since our plans are constantly upset by utterly unforeseen
incidents. He might ask how we know when we have collected
enough information upon which to decide. If we were rigorously
“scienti.c” in collecting information for our decisions, it would take
us so long to collect the data that the time for action would have
passed long before the work had been completed. So how do we
know when we have enough? Does the information itself tell us
that it is enough? On the contrary, we go through the motions of
gathering the necessary information in a rational way, and then, just
gg  y     y,  , j
because of a hunch, or because we are tired of thinking, or because
the time has come to decide, we act. He would ask whether this is
not depending just as much upon “irrelevant tri1es” as if we had
been casting the yarrow stalks.
In other words, the “rigorously scienti.c” method of predicting
the future can be applied only in special cases–where prompt
action is not urgent, where the factors involved are largely
mechanical, or in circumstances so restricted as to be trivial. By far
the greater part of our important decisions depend upon “hunch”–
in other words, upon the “peripheral vision” of the mind. Thus the
reliability of our decisions rests ultimately upon our ability to “feel”
the situation, upon the degree to which this “peripheral vision” has
been developed.
Every exponent of the I Ching knows this. He knows that the
book itself does not contain an exact science, but rather a useful
tool which will work for him if he has a good “intuition,” or if, as
he would say, he is “in the Tao.” Thus one does not consult the
oracle without proper preparation, without going quietly and
meticulously through the prescribed rituals in order to bring the
mind into that calm state where the “intuition” is felt to act more
e5ectively. It would seem, then, that if the origins of Taoism are to
be found in the I Ching, they are not so much in the text of the
book itself as in the way in which it was used and in the
assumptions underlying it. For experience in making decisions by
intuition might well show that this “peripheral” aspect of the mind
works best when we do not try to interfere with it, when we trust it
to work by itself–tzu-jan, spontaneously, “self-so.”
Thus the basic principles of Taoism begin to unfold themselves.
There is, .rst of all, the Tao–the inde.nable, concrete “process” of
the world, the Way of life. The Chinese word means originally a
way or road, and sometimes “to speak,” so that the .rst line of the
Tao Te Ching contains a pun on the two meanings:
The Tao which can be spoken is not eternal Tao.3 f
But in trying at least to suggest what he means, Lao-tzu says:
There was something vague before heaven and earth arose. How
calm! How void! It stands alone, unchanging; it acts everywhere,
untiring. It may be considered the mother of everything under
heaven. I do not know its name, but call it by the word Tao. (25)
And again:
The Tao is something blurred and indistinct.
How indistinct! How blurred!
Yet within it are images.
How blurred! How indistinct!
Yet within it are things.
How dim! How confused!
Yet within it is mental power.
Because this power is most true,
Within it there is confidence. (21)
“Mental! power” is ching, g a word which combines the ideas of
essential, subtle, psychic or spiritual, and skillful. For the point
seems to be that as one’s own head looks like nothing to the eyes
yet is the source of intelligence, so the vague, void-seeming, and
inde.nable Tao is the intelligence which shapes the world with a
skill beyond our understanding.
The important di5erence between the Tao and the usual idea of
God is that whereas God produces the world by making (wei h), the
Tao produces it by “not-making” (w u - w e i i)–which is
approximately what we mean by “growing.” For things made are
separate parts put together, like machines, or things fashioned from
without inwards, like sculptures. Whereas things grown divide
themselves into parts, from within outwards. Because the natural
universe works mainly according to the principles of growth, it
would seem quite odd to the Chinese mind to ask how it was made.
If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who
knows how it is made–who could explain how it was put together
bit by bit as a technician can explain in one-at-a-time words how to
assemble a machine. But a universe which grows utterly excludes
       g y
the possibility of knowing how it grows in the clumsy terms of
thought and language, so that no Taoist would dream of asking
whether the Tao knows how it produces the universe. For it
operates according to spontaneity, not according to plan. Lao-tzu
says:
The Tao’s principle is spontaneity. (25) j
But spontaneity is not by any means a blind, disorderly urge, a
mere power of caprice. A philosophy restricted to the alternatives
of conventional language has no way of conceiving an intelligence
which does not work according to plan, according to a (one-at-atime) order of thought. Yet the concrete evidence of such an
intelligence is right to hand in our own thoughtlessly organized
bodies.3a For the Tao does not “know” how it produces the
universe just as we do not “know” how we construct our brains. In
the words of Lao-tzu’s great successor, Chuang-tzu:
Things are produced around us, but no one knows the whence.
They issue forth, but no one sees the portal. Men one and all
value that part of knowledge which is known. They do not know
how to avail themselves of the Unknown in order to reach
knowledge. Is not this misguided?4
The conventional relationship of the knower to the known is
often that of the controller to the controlled, and thus of lord to
servant. Thus whereas God is the master of the universe, since “he
knows about it all! He knows! He knows!,” the relationship of the
Tao to what it produces is quite otherwise.
The great Tao flows everywhere,
to the left and to the right.
All things depend upon it to exist,
and it does not abandon them.
To its accomplishments it lays no claim.
It loves and nourishes all things,
     g,
but does not lord it over them. (34)
In the usual Western conception God is also self-knowing–
transparent through and through to his own understanding, the
image of what man would like to be: the conscious ruler and
controller, the absolute dictator of his own mind and body. But in
contrast with this, the Tao is through and through mysterious and
dark (hsüan k). As a Zen Buddhist said of it in later times:
There is one thing: above, it supports Heaven; below, it upholds
Earth. It is black like lacquer, always actively functioning.5 l
Hsüan is, of course, a metaphorical darkness–not the darkness of
night, of black as opposed to white, but the sheer inconceivability
which confronts the mind when it tries to remember the time
before birth, or to penetrate its own depths.
Western critics often poke fun at such nebulous views of the
Absolute, deriding them as “misty and mystical” in contrast with
their own robustly definite opinions. But as Lao-tzu said:
When the superior man hears of the Tao,
he does his best to practice it.
When the middling man hears of the Tao,
he sometimes keeps it, and sometimes loses it.
When the inferior man hears of the Tao,
he will laugh aloud at it.
If he did not laugh, it would not be the Tao. (41)
For it is really impossible to appreciate what is meant by the Tao
without becoming, in a rather special sense, stupid. So long as the
conscious intellect is frantically trying to clutch the world in its net
of abstractions, and to insist that life be bound and .tted to its rigid
categories, the mood of Taoism will remain incomprehensible; and
the intellect will wear itself out. The Tao is accessible only to the
mind which can practice the simple and subtle art of wu-wei,
which, after the Tao, is the second important principle of Taoism.
,   ,    p pp 
We saw that the I Ching had given the Chinese mind some
experience in arriving at decisions spontaneously, decisions which
are e5ective to the degree that one knows how to let one’s mind
alone, trusting it to work by itself. This is wu-wei, since wu means
“not” or “non-” and wei means “action,” “making,” “doing,”
“striving,” “straining,” or “busyness.” To return to the illustration of
eyesight, the peripheral vision works most e5ectively–as in the
dark–when we see out of the corners of the eyes, and do not look at
things directly. Similarly, when we need to see the details of a
distant object, such as a clock, the eyes must be relaxed, not staring,
not trying to see. So, too, no amount of working with the muscles of
the mouth and tongue will enable us to taste our food more acutely.
The eyes and the tongue must be trusted to do the work by
themselves.
But when we have learned to put excessive reliance upon central
vision, upon the sharp spotlight of the eyes and mind, we cannot
regain the powers of peripheral vision unless the sharp and staring
kind of sight is .rst relaxed. The mental or psychological equivalent
of this is the special kind of stupidity to which Lao-tzu and Chuangtzu so often refer. It is not simply calmness of mind, but “nongraspingness” of mind. In Chuangtzu’s words, “The perfect man
employs his mind as a mirror. It grasps nothing; it refuses nothing.
It receives, but does not keep.” One might almost say that it
“fuzzes” itself a little to compensate for too harsh a clarity. Thus
Lao-tzu says of himself:
Cut out cleverness and there are no anxieties! …
People in general are so happy, as if enjoying a feast,
Or as going up a tower in spring.
I alone am tranquil, and have made no signs,
Like a baby who is yet unable to smile;
Forlorn as if I had no home to go to.
Others all have more than enough,
And I alone seem to be in want.
Possibly mine is the mind of a fool,
Which is so ignorant!
   g
The vulgar are bright,
And I alone seem to be dull.
The vulgar are discriminative,
And I alone seem to be blunt.
I am negligent as if being obscure;
Drifting, as if being attached to nothing.
The people in general all have something to do,
And I alone seem to be impractical and awkward.
I alone am different from others,
But I value seeking sustenance from the Mother (Tao).
(20)6
In most Taoist writings there is a slight degree of exaggeration or
overstatement of the point which is actually a kind of humor, a selfcaricature. Thus Chuang-tzu writes on the same theme:
The man of character (te) lives at home without exercising his
mind and performs actions without worry. The notions of right
and wrong and the praise and blame of others do not disturb
him. When within the four seas all people can enjoy themselves,
that is happiness for him.… Sorrowful in countenance, he looks
like a baby who has lost his mother; appearing stupid, he goes
about like one who has lost his way. He has plenty of money to
spend, but does not know where it comes from. He drinks and
eats just enough and does not know where the food comes from.
(3:13)7
Lao-tzu is still more forceful in his apparent condemnation of
conventional cleverness:
Cut out sagacity; discard knowingness,
and the people will benefit an hundredfold.
Cut out “humanity”; discard righteousness,
and the people will regain love of their fellows.
Cut out cleverness; discard the utilitarian,
and there will be no thieves and robbers.…
      
Become unaffected;8
Cherish sincerity;
Belittle the personal;
Reduce desires. (19)
The idea is not to reduce the human mind to a moronic vacuity,
but to bring into play its innate and spontaneous intelligence by
using it without forcing it. It is fundamental to both Taoist and
Confucian thought that the natural man is to be trusted, and from
their standpoint it appears that the Western mistrust of human
nature–whether theological or technological–is a kind of
schizophrenia. It would be impossible, in their view, to believe
oneself innately evil without discrediting the very belief, since all
the notions of a perverted mind would be perverted notions.
However religiously “emancipated,” the technological mind shows
that it has inherited the same division against itself when it tries to
subject the whole human order to the control of conscious reason. It
forgets that reason cannot be trusted if the brain cannot be trusted,
since the power of reason depends upon organs that were grown by
“unconscious intelligence.”
The art of letting the mind alone is vividly described by another
Taoist writer, Lieh-tzu (c. 398 B.C.), celebrated for his mysterious
power of being able to ride upon the wind. This, no doubt, refers to
the peculiar sensation of “walking on air” which arises when the
mind is .rst liberated. It is said that when Professor D. T. Suzuki
was once asked how it feels to have attained satori,o the Zen
experience of “awakening,” he answered, “Just like ordinary
everyday experience, except about two inches o5 the ground!” Thus
when asked to explain the art of riding on the wind, Lieh-tzu gave
the following account of his training under his master Lao Shang:
After I had served him … for the space of three years, my mind
did not venture to re1ect on right and wrong, my lips did not
venture to speak of pro.t and loss. Then, for the .rst time, my
master bestowed one glance upon me- and that was all.
At the end of .ve years a change had taken place; my mind
     y  g   p; y
was re1ecting on right and wrong, and my lips were speaking of
pro.t and loss. Then, for the .rst time, my master relaxed his
countenance and smiled.
At the end of seven years, there was another change. I let my
mind re1ect on what it would, but it no longer occupied itself
with right and wrong. I let my lips utter whatsoever they pleased,
but they no longer spoke of pro.t and loss. Then, at last, my
master led me in to sit on the mat beside him.
At the end of nine years, my mind gave free rein to its
reflections,p my mouth free passage to its speech. Of right and
wrong, pro.t and loss, I had no knowledge, either as touching
myself or others.… Internal and external were blended into unity.
After that, there was no distinction between eye and ear, ear and
nose, nose and mouth: all were the same. My mind was frozen,
my body in dissolution, my 1esh and bones all melted together. I
was wholly unconscious of what my body was resting on, or what
was under my feet. I was borne this way and that on the wind,
like dry cha5 or leaves falling from a tree. In fact, I knew not
whether the wind was riding on me or I on the wind.9
The state of consciousness described sounds not unlike being
pleasantly drunk–though without the “morning after” e5ects of
alcohol! Chuang-tzu noticed the similarity, for he wrote:
A drunken man who falls out of a cart, though he may su5er,
does not die. His bones are the same as other people’s; but he
meets the accident in a di5erent way. His spirit is in a condition
of security. He is not conscious of riding in the cart; neither is he
conscious of falling out of it. Ideas of life, death, fear, etc., cannot
penetrate his breast; and so he does not su5er from contact with
objective existences. And if such security is to be got from wine,
how much more is it to be got from Spontaneity. (19)10
Since Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, and Lieh-tzu were all conscious enough
to write very intelligible books, it may be assumed that some of this
language is, again, exaggerated or metaphorical. Their
gg , g, gg  p
“unconsciousness” is not coma, but what the exponents of Zen later
signi.ed by wu-hsin,q literally “no-mind,” which is to say un-selfconsciousness. It is a state of wholeness in which the mind functions
freely and easily, without the sensation of a second mind or ego
standing over it with a club. If the ordinary man is one who has to
walk by lifting his legs with his hands, the Taoist is one who has
learned to let the legs walk by themselves.
Various passages in the Taoist writings suggest that “nomindedness” is employing the whole mind as we use the eyes when
we rest them upon various objects but make no special e5ort to
take anything in. According to Chuang-tzu:
The baby looks at things all day without winking; that is because
his eyes are not focussed on any particular object. He goes
without knowing where he is going, and stops without knowing
what he is doing. He merges himself with the surroundings and
moves along with it. These are the principles of mental hygiene.
(23)11
And again:
If you regulate your body and unify your attention, the harmony
of heaven will come upon you. If you integrate your awareness,
and unify your thoughts, spirit will make its abode with you. Te
(virtue) will clothe you, and the Tao will shelter you. Your eyes
will be like those of a new-born calf, which seeks not the
wherefore. (22)
Each of the other senses might similarly be used to illustrate the
“non-active” functioning of the mind–listening without straining to
hear, smelling without strong inhalation, tasting without screwing
up the tongue, and touching without pressing the object. Each is a
special instance of the mental function which works through all,
and which Chinese designates with the peculiar word hsin.r
This term is so important for the understanding of Zen that some
attempt must be made to say what Taoism and Chinese thought in
p     y     g
general take it to mean.12 We usually translate it as “mind” or
“heart,” but neither of these words is satisfactory. The original form
of the ideograph8 seems to be a picture of the heart, or perhaps of
the lungs or the liver, and when a Chinese speaks of the hsin he
will often point to the center of his chest, slightly lower than the
heart.
The di4culty with our translations is that “mind” is too
intellectual, too cortical, and that “heart” in its current English usage
is too emotional–even sentimental. Furthermore, hsin is not always
used with quite the same sense. Sometimes it is used for an
obstruction to be removed, as in wu-hsin, “no-mind.” But
sometimes it is used in a way that is almost synonymous with the
Tao. This is especially found in Zen literature, which abounds with
such phrases as “original mind” (pen hsin t), “Buddha mind” (fu
hsin u), or “faith in mind” (hsin hsin v). This apparent contradiction
is resolved in the principle that “the true mind is no mind,” which
is to say that the hsin is true, is working properly, when it works as
if it were not present. In the same way, the eyes are seeing properly
when they do not see themselves, in terms of spots or blotches in
the air.
All in all, it would seem that hsin means the totality of our
psychic functioning, and, more speci.cally, the center of that
functioning, which is associated with the central point of the upper
body. The Japanese form of the word, kokoro, is used with even
more subtleties of meaning, but for the present it is enough to
realize that in translating it “mind” (a su4ciently vague word) we
do not mean exclusively the intellectual or thinking mind, nor even
the surface consciousness. The important point is that, according to
both Taoism and Zen, the center of the mind’s activity is not in the
conscious thinking process, not in the ego.
When a man has learned to let his mind alone so that it functions
in the integrated and spontaneous way that is natural to it, he
begins to show the special kind of “virtue” or “power” called te.
This is not virtue in the current sense of moral rectitude but in the
older sense of e5ectiveness, as when one speaks of the healing
virtues of a plant. Te is, furthermore, una5ected or spontaneous
   p  , ,   p
virtue which cannot be cultivated or imitated by any deliberate
method. Lao-tzu says:
Superior te is not te,
and thus has te.
Inferior te does not let go of te,
and thus is not te.
Superior te is non-active [wu-wei] and aimless.
Inferior te is active and has an aim. (38)
The literal translation has a strength and depth which is lost in such
paraphrases as “Superior virtue is not conscious of itself as virtue,
and thus really is virtue. Inferior virtue cannot dispense with
virtuosity, and thus is not virtue.”
When the Confucians prescribed a virtue which depended upon
the arti.cial observance of rules and precepts, the Taoists pointed
out that such virtue was conventional and not genuine. Chuang-tzu
made up the following imaginary dialogue between Confucius and
Lao-tzu:
“Tell me,” said Lao-tzu, “in what consist charity and duty to one’s
neighbour?”
“They consist,” answered Confucius, “in a capacity for rejoicing
in all things; in universal love, without the element of self. These
are the characteristics of charity and duty to one’s neighbour.”
“What stu5!” cried Lao-tzu. “Does not universal love contradict
itself? Is not your elimination of self a positive manifestation of
self? Sir, if you would cause the empire not to lose its source of
nourishment,–there is the universe, its regularity is unceasing;
there are the sun and moon, their brightness is unceasing; there
are the stars, their groupings never change; there are the birds
and beasts, they 1ock together without varying; there are trees
and shrubs, they grow upwards without exception. Be like these:
follow Tao, and you will be perfect. Why then these vain
struggles after charity and duty to one’s neighbour, as though
beating a drum in search of a fugitive. Alas! Sir, you have brought
g       g  , y  g
much confusion into the mind of man.” (13)13
The Taoist critique of conventional virtue applied not only in the
moral sphere but also in the arts, crafts, and trades. According to
Chuang-tzu:
Ch’ui the artisan could draw circles with his hand better than
with compasses. His .ngers seemed to accommodate themselves
so naturally to the thing he was working at, that it was
unnecessary to .x his attention. His mental faculties thus
remained One (i.e., integrated), and su5ered no hindrance. To be
unconscious of one’s feet implies that the shoes are easy. To be
unconscious of a waist implies that the girdle is easy. The
intelligence being unconscious of positive and negative implies
that the heart (hsin) is at ease.… And he who, beginning with
ease, is never not at ease, is unconscious of the ease of ease.
(19)14
Just as the artisan who had mastered te could do without the
arti.ciality of the compass, so the painter, the musician, and the
cook would have no need for the conventional classi.cations of
their respective arts. Thus Lao-tzu said:
The five colours will blind a man’s sight.
The five sounds will deaden a mans hearing.
The five tastes will spoil a man’s palate.
Chasing and hunting will drive a man wild.
Things hard to get will do harm to a man’s conduct.
Therefore the sage makes provision for the stomach and
not for the eye. (12)15
This must by no means be taken as an ascetic’s hatred of sense
experience, for the point is precisely that the eye’s sensitivity to
color is impaired by the .xed idea that there are just .ve true
colors. There is an in.nite continuity of shading, and breaking it
     y  g,  g
down into divisions with names distracts the attention from its
subtlety. This is why “the sage makes provision for the stomach and
not for the eye,” which is to say that he judges by the concrete
content of the experience, and not by its conformity with purely
theoretical standards.
In sum, then, te is the unthinkable ingenuity and creative power
of man’s spontaneous and natural functioning–a power which is
blocked when one tries to master it in terms of formal methods and
techniques. It is like the centipede’s skill in using a hundred legs at
once.
The centipede was happy, quite,
Until a toad in fun
Said, “Pray, which leg goes after which?”
This worked his mind to such a pitch,
He lay distracted in a ditch,
Considering how to run.
A profound regard for te underlies the entire higher culture of the
Far East, so much so that it has been made the basic principle of
every kind of art and craft. While it is true that these arts employ
what are, to us, highly di4cult technical disciplines, it is always
recognized that they are instrumental and secondary, and that
superior work has the quality of an accident. This is not merely a
masterful mimicry of the accidental, an assumed spontaneity in
which the careful planning does not show. It lies at a much deeper
and more genuine level, for what the culture of Taoism and Zen
proposes is that one might become the kind of person who, without
intending it, is a source of marvelous accidents.
Taoism is, then, the original Chinese way of liberation which
combined with Indian Mahayana Buddhism to produce Zen. It is a
liberation from convention and of the creative power of te. Every
attempt to describe and formulate it in words and one-at-a-time
thought symbols must, of necessity, distort it. The foregoing chapter
has perforce made it seem one of the “vitalist” or “naturalistic”
philosophical alternatives. For Western philosophers are constantly

bedeviled by the discovery that they cannot think outside certain
well-worn ruts–that, however hard they may try, their “new”
philosophies turn out to be restatements of ancient positions,
monist or pluralist, realist or nominalist, vitalist or mechanist. This
is because these are the only alternatives which the conventions of
thought can present, and they cannot discuss anything else without
presenting it in their own terms. When we try to represent a third
dimension upon a two-dimensional surface, it will of necessity
seem to belong more or less to the two alternatives of length and
breadth. In the words of Chuang-tzu:
Were language adequate, it would take but a day fully to set forth
Tao. Not being adequate, it takes that time to explain material
existences. Tao is something beyond material existences. It cannot
be conveyed either by words or by silence. (
